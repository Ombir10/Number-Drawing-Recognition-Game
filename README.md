# Number-Drawing-Recognition-Game
This project is based on Computer Vision for drawing numbers to calculate simple arithmetic calculations. Player will draw a number using their index finger infront of the camera, the movement of the finger is tracked using the mediapipe library. Likewise, to capture the video from the camera, we will use a open source OpenCV library.
